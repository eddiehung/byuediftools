This file contains a description of a 
known matching issue in the edif merge parser.

The isi design "fftcore" illustrates the problem

One cell contains the interface of a cell called 
"RAMB16_S9_S9", and a different cell also contains 
the interface for the same cell, but the port 
names are different and the matcher currently does
not successfully match the cells.  A brief section
of the two interface definition is given below.
