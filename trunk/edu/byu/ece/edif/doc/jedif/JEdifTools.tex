\section{Introduction}
The BYU-LANL Triple Modular Redundancy (BLTmr) Tool is an EDIF-based tool to 
insert redundancy in an FPGA design in order to increase reliability. Triple 
modular redundancy (TMR) is applied to the EDIF input file according to the 
options chosen by the user. Partial TMR focuses on ``persistent'' components of 
the design in order to get the ``most bang for your buck.''

\section{TMR Toolflow}
The Tool is split into several subtools. This allows the user to adjust various 
command-line options in one phase, and then move onto the next phase, without
having to wait for the entire TMR process to complete.

\subsection{JEdifBuild}
JEdifBuild creates merged netlists in a .jedif file format from 
multiple .edif files. The .jedif file format is used by all the TMR tools.

\subsection{JEdifNetList}
JEdifNetList will convert a .jedif file into an .edf file for use with other
standard edif tools 

\subsection{JEdifSterilize}
The first Tool in the TMR chain. This tool removes HalfLatches and FMAPs. If the 
design does not have any, this tool is optional.

\subsection{JEdifTMRAnalysis}
This tool determines what parts of the cell to triplicate, and where to put voters,
based on user input and the size of the device.

\subsection{JEdifCutset}
This tool finds all the feedback in the design, and creates of list of voters
to be instered to interupt all feedback.

\subsection{JEdifMoreFrequentVoting}
\emph{Optional:} Inserts extra voters for more frequent voting within
the design.

\subsection{JEdifTMR}
Takes information about voter placement from the previous steps, and
creates a new design incorperating that information. Can output either
a JEdif or an EDIF file.

\subsection{EdifTMR}
The EdifTMR tools combines all the tools in the JEdifTMR toolflow into
one easy step. If you already know exactly what setting you wish use
to perform TMR, this tool will be faster.

\subsection{JEdifQuery}
JEdifQuery is a tool used to query the contents of a jedif file and to 
provide summary information about the EDIF design contained within.

\subsection{Other JEdif tools}
\subsubsection{JEdifClockDomain} 
The BYU-LANL JEdif Clock Domain Parser is a jedif-based tool to parse FPGA
designs to obtain information about the clock(s). The parser first identifies
all clocks in a design. This information is then used to optionally display
other information, such as classifying Xilinx primitives into one or more 
domains, showing clock crossings, etc.

It is analagous to the EDIF-based Clock Domain Parser.

\section{Special Notes}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Naming Conventions}
\label{naming conventions}
The BLTmr tool alters the names of triplicated signals, cell instances, and 
ports. Be aware of this when using placement (or other) constraints. An output 
port named \texttt{myOutport} in the original EDIF file will, when triplicated, 
become \texttt{myOutport\_TMR\_0, myOutport\_TMR\_1, and myOutport\_TMR\_2}. 
Similarly, a flip-flop whose instance name is \texttt{myFF} in the original file
will become \texttt{myFF\_TMR\_0}, \texttt{myFF\_TMR\_1}, 
\texttt{and myFF\_TMR\_2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Allocating More Memory for the JVM}
Larger designs may require more heap memory than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
is allocated by default. Use the \texttt{-Xmx}
\footnote{See 
\url{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/java.html\#Xms} 
for more information about this and other command-line options to the JVM.} 
option with the Java executable to change the maximum amount of memory for 
the virtual machine. The following example allocates up to 256 MB of 
heap space for the JVM:

\begin{verbatim}
> java -Xmx256M byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR ...
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{RLOC Constraints}
The BLTmr tool does not support RLOC constraints at this time. RLOC constraints 
must therefore be removed before processing the resulting EDIF file. RLOCs may 
be removed from the either the source EDIF files (including any external EDIF 
files) or from the triplicated output file. Automated RLOC removal may be added 
to the tool in a later release.

To remove RLOC constraints from an EDIF file, you can use the UNIX 
\texttt{grep} tool. The following example uses \texttt{grep} to find all lines 
in the source EDIF file \texttt{myDesign\_BLTmr.edf} that do \emph{not} contain 
the string \texttt{RLOC} and copy them to the destination EDIF file 
\texttt{myDesign\_tmr\_noRLOCs.edf.} Note that you may \emph{not} use the same 
file for the source and destination.

\begin{verbatim}
> grep -v RLOC myDesign_BLTmr.edf > myDesign_BLTmr_noRLOCs.edf
\end{verbatim}

This trick is guaranteed to work for EDIF files created by the BLTmr tool as 
well as all Xilinx CoreGen EDIF files. It is \emph{not} guaranteed to work for 
all EDIF files in general since it relies on the fact that each RLOC constraint 
with its associated parentheses do not spread across multiple lines (which is 
not required by the EDIF file format). For example, it does not work for EDIF 
files created with the JHDL netlister.
