\subsection{Voter Options}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--voter\_threshold <voter\_threshold>}}
Voter insertion threshold. The number of instances allowed between voters.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--num\_partitions <num\_partitions>}}
The number of partitions desired in the output circuit. The partitions are
created in equal sizes, if possible. This number is currently calculated from
the maximum depth of the circuit. A more sophisticated algorithm may be
provided in the future.
