\subsection{Target Part Options}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--part <partname>}}
Target architecture for the design. Used to take into account 
part-specific properties, including the number of resources available 
in each part. Valid parts include all parts from the \emph{Virtex} and 
\emph{Virtex2} product lines, represented as a concatenation of the part name 
and package type. For example, the ``Xilinx Virtex 1000 FG680'' is represented 
as \texttt{XCV1000FG680}. This argument is \emph{not} case-sensitive.

Default: \texttt{xcv1000fg680}.
