Change Log for BYU EDIF Tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Proton Release - Version 0.5.1 (9 July 2009)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

    * Four new cutset algorithms (experimental)
    * An experimental recovery distance analyzer (measures # of FFs between voters)
    
Bug Fixes:
    
    * A flattening bug in which certain portRefs could be duplicated
    * 2 voter insertion bugs related to the number of voters inserted
      at particular locations
    * An issue related to preserved hierarchy not being written to a
      flattened .jedif file when the -o option was used with JEdifBuild
    
Enhancements / Other:
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Proton Release - Version 0.5.0 (20 May 2009)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

    * Support for integration of TMR/DWC in a single design
    * Support for TMR detectors
    * Pre-mitigated top-level port support
    * Pre-mitigated component support
    * New options for selecting design portions for replication
      (multi-pass selection)
    * New tool (JEdifReplicationQuery) for outputting
      information about what type of replication will be performed
      (i.e. which instances will be triplicated/duplicated,
      where voters/detectors will be inserted/etc.)
    * EDIF properties can be used to force/prevent voting and
      detecting
    * EDIF properties can be used to prevent flattening of
      selected components
    
Bug Fixes:
    
    * Various LUT RAM/SRL replacement issues
    * Null pointer exception issue with half-latch replacement
    
Enhancements / Other:

    * New replication toolflow
	* Half-latch removal tool is rewritten for maintainability
	* Flattening code now preserves net hierarchy name references
	  (previously only instance hierarchy was actually preserved)
	* Speed improvements for replication step (JEdifNMR)
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Electron Release - Version 0.4.1 (1 Dec 2008)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

    * New LUT RAM/SRL replacement tool integrated with JEdif Tools
    * Added Xilinx QPro parts to the set of valid devices

Bug Fixes:

	* Fixed --tmr_p option. --tmr_p will now include the listed ports
	* Tool now handles case-insensitive matches of *.ngc files
	* Fixed bug related to tying of DCM ports with half-latch safe constants

Enhancements / Other:


-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

  * Added new file format for specifying black-box usage
  * Added support for finding *.ndf files
  * Added options to ignore hard and soft resource utilization limits

Bug Fixes:

  * Fixed bug in JEdifTMRAnalysis in which the –tmr_p and –no_tmr_p 
    command line options were functionally switched

Enhancements / Other:

  * Further re-organization of package structure and class names
  * Completed re-formatting of source code

-------------------------------------------------------------------
