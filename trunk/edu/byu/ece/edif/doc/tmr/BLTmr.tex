\section{Introduction}
The BYU-LANL Triple Modular Redundancy (BLTmr) Tool is an EDIF-based tool to 
insert redundancy in an FPGA design in order to increase reliability. Triple 
modular redundancy (TMR) is applied to the EDIF input file according to the 
options chosen by the user. Partial TMR focuses on ``persistent'' components of 
the design in order to get the ``most bang for your buck.''

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{File options: input, output, etc.}
The following options specify the top-level input EDIF file, any auxiliary EDIF
files, and the destination EDIF file.

\subsubsection{\texttt{<input\_file>}}
Filename and path to the EDIF source file containing the top-level cell to be 
triplicated. This is the only required parameter.

\subsubsection{\texttt{(-o|--output) <output\_file>}}
Filename and path to the triplicated EDIF output file created by the BLTmr
tool. 

Default: \texttt{BLTmr.edf} in the current working directory.

\subsubsection{\texttt{(-d|--dir) dir1,dir2,\ldots,dir3}}
Comma-separated list of directories containing external EDIF files referenced 
by the top-level EDIF file. The current working directory is included by 
default and need not be specified. There can be multiple \texttt{-d} options.

Example: \texttt{-d aux\_files,/usr/share/edif/common -d moreEdifFiles/}

\subsubsection{\texttt{(-f|--file) file1,file2,\ldots,fileN}}
Similar to the previous option, but rather than specifying directories to 
search, each external EDIF file is named explicitly---including the path to the 
file. There can be multiple \texttt{-f} options. 

Example: \texttt{-f multBox.edn,src/adder.edf -f /usr/share/edif/blackBox.edf}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR Options}
The following options control the manner in which the BLTmr tool performs
triplication: whether to do full or partial TMR; what specific ports, cell
types, and cell instances to be triplicated; and how to handle strongly
connected components (SCCs).

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmrSuffix}}
This option allows the user to specify the suffixes that the tool adds to each
of the replicated design elements (nets, cell instances, etc.). The user must
specify all three suffixes (in a comma-separated list) to be used for each of
the three TMR domains. In addition, each of the domains must be unique to avoid
naming conflicts. One of suffixes may be left blank to signify that no suffix
should be added to the elements of that domain.

As an example, if the user specified the following list of suffixes:

\texttt{--tmrSuffix \_0,\_1,\_2}

a net in the original design called \texttt{reset} would be triplicated as:

\texttt{reset\_0, reset\_1, and reset\_2}.

The default suffixes (if the \texttt{--tmrSuffix} option is not used) are 
\texttt{\_TMR\_0, \_TMR\_1, and \_TMR\_2}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--full\_tmr}}
Fully triplicate the design, skipping all partial TMR analysis. This method is 
preferred only if the design is expected to fit in the target part with full 
triplication of every resource since some time-consuming algorithms are skipped.
Resource utilization estimates will still function, stopping triplication and 
warning the user if the full triplicated design is not expected to fit in the 
target part. In this case, the partially-triplicated design will still be 
written out to file, but the user would most likely benefit from the partial 
TMR algorithms.

Note: \texttt{--full\_tmr} will triplicate all logic within the design; however, 
top-level ports are not triplicated by default. To triplicate top-level ports,
use the \texttt{--tmr\_in\-ports} and \texttt{--tmr\_outports} options.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmr\_inports}}
Force triplication of all top-level input ports. The resulting EDIF file will
have three input ports for every input port in the original design, with names
such as \texttt{inputPort\_tmrInstance\_0}, \texttt{inputPort\_tmrInstance\_1},
and \texttt{inputPort\_tmrInstance\_2}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmr\_outports}}
Force triplication of all top-level output ports. The resulting EDIF file will
have three output ports for every output port in the original design, with names 
such as \texttt{outputPort\_tmrInstance\_0}, 
\texttt{output\-Port\_tmr\-Instance\_1}, and 
\texttt{outputPort\_tmrInstance\_2}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_p port1,port2,\ldots,portN}}
Prevent triplication of specific top-level port(s), specified as a 
comma-separated list. Used in conjunction with \texttt{--tmr\_inports} and 
\texttt{--tmr\_outports}. For example, the following will triplicate all input 
ports except the clock and reset ports, assuming \texttt{Clk} and \texttt{rst} 
are the (case-sensitive) names of the clock and reset input ports, respectively:

\texttt{--tmr\_inports --no\_tmr\_p Clk,rst} 

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmr\_c cell\_type1,cell\_type2,\ldots,cell\_typeN}}
Force triplication of specific cell type(s), specified as a comma-separated list. 
All instances of the types specified will be triplicated. \texttt{--tmr\_c}
takes precedence over \texttt{--no\_tmr\_c}. There can be multiple 
\texttt{--tmr\_c} options.

Examples: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{--tmr\_c bufg,ibufg,fdc}
\item \texttt{--tmr\_c bufg,ibufg --tmr\_c fdc}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmr\_clk clock\_domain1,clock\_domain2,...,clock\_domainN}}
Force triplication of specific clock domain(s), specified as a comma-separated
list. All instances belonging to the specified will be triplicated.
\texttt{--tmr\_clk}
takes precedence over \texttt{--no\_tmr\_clk}. There can be multiple 
\texttt{--tmr\_clk} options.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--tmr\_i cell\_instance1,cell\_instance2,\ldots,cell\_instanceN}}
Force triplication of specific cell instance(s), specified as a comma-separated
list. Each instance should be specified with its full path, not including the
top level instance name, each level being separated by '/' Note:
\texttt{--no\_tmr\_i} takes precedence over \texttt{--tmr\_i}. There can be
multiple \texttt{--tmr\_i} options.

Example: \texttt{--tmr\_i clk\_bufg,multiplier16/adder16/fullAdder0}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_c cell\_type1,cell\_type2,\ldots,cell\_typeN}}
Prevent triplication of specific cell type(s), specified as a comma-separated 
list. There can be multiple \texttt{--no\_tmr\_c} options.

Example: \texttt{--no\_tmr\_c bufg,ibufg,fdc}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_clk clock\_domain1,clock\_domain2,...,clock\_domainN}}
Force triplication of specific clock domain(s), specified as a comma-separated
list. All instances belonging to the specified will be triplicated.
\texttt{--no\_tmr\_clk} takes precedence over \texttt{--no\_tmr\_clk}. There can
be multiple \texttt{--no\_tmr\_clk} options.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_i cell\_instance1,cell\_instance2,\ldots,cell\_instanceN}}
Prevent triplication of specific cell instance(s), specified as a 
comma-separated list. There can be multiple \texttt{--no\_tmr\_i} options.

Example: \texttt{--no\_tmr\_i clk\_bufg,multiplier16/adder16/fullAdder0}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_feedback}}
Skip triplication of the feedback section of the design. 
Is it \emph{not} recommended to skip triplication of the feedback section, as 
it is the most critical section for SEU mitigation.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_input\_to\_feedback}}
Skip triplication of the portions of the design that ``feed into'' the feedback 
sections. These portions also contribute to the ``persistence'' of the design 
and should be included in triplication, when possible.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_feedback\_output}}
Skip triplication of the portions of the design which are driven by the 
feedback sections of the design.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_tmr\_feed\_forward}}
Skip triplication of the portions of the design which are not related to 
feedback sections (neither drive nor are driven by the feedback sections).

\subsubsection{\texttt{--noInoutCheck}}
% By default, designs with INOUT ports are not allowed, since the BLTmr tool 
% currently does not support all aspects of INOUT ports. This option forces the 
% tool to allow designs with INOUT ports, which \emph{may} result in a working 
% TMR'd design, but might not.
\textbf{Deprecated} - The BLTmr tool no longer checks for INOUT ports since they
are handled correctly in most cases.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--no\_iob\_feedback}}
Use this option to exclude IOBs from the feedback analysis. This is useful when
a top-level inout port is involved in feedback but by design will never be 
written to and read at the same time. Thus there is no \emph{real} feedback.
Using this option may greatly reduce the amount of feedback found in the design
and thus reduce the number of voters inserted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SCC Options}
The following options control how BLTmr handles strongly connected components 
(SCCs) and related logic. An SCC, by definition, is a set of circuit components 
that are mutually reachable. That is, following the flow of data, every 
component in the SCC can be reached from every other. In an SCC, each component 
is related to every other component. The feedback section is defined as the 
combination of all the strongly-connected components (SCCs). The following 
options determine the order in which SCCs and related logic are triplicated as 
well as whether or not SCCs can be partitioned into smaller components.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--SCCSortType} $\{1,2,3\}$}
Choose the method the BLTmr tool uses to partially triplicate logic in the 
``feedback'' section of the design.  Option 1 triplicates the largest SCCs 
first. Option 2 triplicates the smallest first. Option 3 triplicates the SCCs 
in topological order.

This option only affects the resulting circuit if only some of the feedback 
section is triplicated. If all or none of the ``feedback'' section is 
triplicated, the three options produce identical results. The difference lies 
in what \emph{order} the logic in this section is added and thus what part of 
it is triplicated if there are not enough resources available to triplicate the 
entire section.

Valid options are \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, and \texttt{3}. Default: \texttt{3}
(topological order).

\subsubsection{\texttt{--doSCCDecomposition}}
Allow portions of strongly-connected components (SCCs) to be included for 
triplication. 

By default, if a single SCC is so large that it cannot be triplicated for the 
target part, it is skipped. This option allows large SCCs to be broken up into 
smaller pieces, some of which may fit in the part. This is only useful if there 
are not enough resources to triplicate the entire set of SCCs.


\subsubsection{\texttt{--use\_bad\_cut\_conn}}
Instructs BLTmr to use the ``BadCutConnectivity'' style graph to choose
SCC elements for triplication. This may have better performance than the 
default algorithm.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--highest\_fanout\_cutset}}
Instructs BLTmr to try to insert voters at the outputs of the instances with 
the highest fanout (those that drive the most sinks), when inserting voters 
in SCCs.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--highest\_ff\_fanout\_cutset}}
Instructs BLTmr to try to insert voters at the outputs of the flip-flops with 
the highest fanout (those that drive the most sinks), when inserting voters 
in SCCs.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--inputAdditionType} $\{1,2,3\}$}
Select between three different algorithms to partially triplicate logic in the 
``input to feedback'' section of the design. Option 1 uses a depth-first search 
starting from the inputs to the feedback section. Option 3 uses a breadth-first 
search. Option 2 uses a combination of the two.

This option only affects the resulting circuit if only some of the input
to feedback section is triplicated. If all or none of the input to feedback 
section is triplicated, the three options produce identical results. The 
difference is in what \emph{order} the logic in this section is added and thus 
what part of it is triplicated if there are not enough resources available to 
triplicate the entire section.

Results may differ between the three addition types depending on the input 
design. It is yet not clear if one method is superior to the others in general. 

Valid options are \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, and \texttt{3}. Default: \texttt{3} 
(breadth-first search).

\subsubsection{\texttt{--outputAdditionType} $\{1,2,3\}$}
Similar to \texttt{--inputAdditionType}, this option applies to the logic 
in the ``feedback output'' section, that is, logic that is driven by the
feedback section.

This option only affects the resulting circuit if only some of the feedback 
output section is triplicated. It has no effect if all or none of the feedback 
output section is triplicated. As with \texttt{--inputAdditionType}, it is yet
not clear if one method is superior to the others in general.

Valid options are \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, and \texttt{3}. Default: \texttt{3} 
(breadth-first search).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Merge Factor and Optimization Factor}
The following factors are used by the utilization tracker, which estimates the 
anticipated usage of the target chip after performing (partial) TMR\@. All factors
in this section have the precision of a Java \texttt{double}. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{--mergeFactor} $\{ 0 \leq n \leq 1 \}$ }
Used to fine-tune the estimation of logic resources in the target chip. Each 
technology has an internal, default ``merge factor'' which estimates the 
percentage of LUTs and flip-flops that will share the same slice. As this 
factor is both technology and design dependent, this option allows the user to 
specify his/her own merge factor. 

The total number of logic blocks (without taking into account optimization) is 
given by the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{total~logic~blocks} = FFs + LUTs - (mergeFactor * FFs)
\end{equation*}

If you need to calculate a custom mergeFactor for a specific design, use the 
following equation:
\begin{equation*}
mergeFactor = \frac{(FFs + LUTs - 2 * slices)}{FFs}
\end{equation*}

Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. Default: 0.5.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--optimizationFactor} $\{ 0 \leq n \leq 1 \}$}
The ``optimization factor'' is used to scale down the estimate of LUTs and 
flip-flops used to account for logic optimization performed during mapping. For 
example, an optimization factor of 0.90 would assume that logic optimization 
techniques would reduce the required number of LUTs and FFs by 10\%.

We define the optimization factor to be the number of logic blocks after 
optimization divided by the number of logic blocks before optimization.  So the 
final equation for the total number of logic blocks is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Estimate} = optimization\_factor * (FFs + LUTs -  mergeFactor * FFs)
\end{equation*}

Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. Default: 0.95.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Utilization Factors and Multiple EDIF Creation}
Starting with version 0.2.2, BLTmr allows the user to create either a single 
EDIF file or multiple EDIF files, each with a different amount of partial TMR.
In either case, the amount of partial TMR is specified with a Utilization Factor
Type and a Utilization Factor Value.  The Factor Value is either a single value
or a range of values specified by a lower bound, an upper bound, and an 
incremental step size.

Multiple EDIF Creation is activated by the use of both the \texttt{--low} and
\texttt{--high} parameters.  Using one without the other will result in an error
and BLTmr will not run.

When creating a single EDIF file, BLTmr will place the output file in the
current directory by default, or in the location specified by the
\texttt{--output} option. When creating multiple EDIF files, BLTmr will place
each EDIF file in its own subdirectory within the current directory. Both the 
subdirectory and the EDIF file will have a unique name that identifies the level
of partial TMR used.  

For example, given the following set of command-line parameters: 

\begin{verbatim}
> java ... --low 0.50 --high 1.0 --inc .10 --factorType asuf MyDesign.edf
\end{verbatim} 
BLTmr will create six EDIF files, starting with 
\texttt{MyDesign\_asuf\_0\_5.edf}, \texttt{MyDesign\_asuf\_0\_6.edf}, 
\\\texttt{MyDesign\_asuf\_0\_7.edf}, and ending with 
\texttt{MyDesign\_asuf\_1.edf}. Each EDIF file would be placed in separate 
directories, whose names would be the same as the name of each EDIF file.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--factorType} $\{ \mathtt{ASUF},\mathtt{UEF},\mathtt{DUF} \}$ }
Specify the Utilization Factor Type to be used. Valid Factor Types are:

\begin{itemize}
\item ASUF 

Available Space Utilization Factor: The maximum utilization of the target part,
expressed as a percentage of the unused space on the part after the original
(non-TMR'd) design has been considered.

\item UEF 

Utilization Expansion Factor: The maximum increase in utilization of the target
part, expressed as a percentage of the utilization of the original (non-TMR'd)
design.

\item DUF 

Desired Utilization Factor: The maximum percentage of the target chip to be
utilized after performing Partial TMR.
\end{itemize}



Not case sensitive.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--factorValue}}
Specify a single Factor Value.  The number has the precision of a Java 
\texttt{double} and is interpretted based on the Factor Type as explained above.

For example, if a design occupies 30\% of the target part prior to TMR, a DUF
of 0.50 would use 50\% of the part. An UEF of 0.50 would increase the usage by
50\%, resulting in 45\% usage of the part. An ASUF of 0.50 would use 50\% of the
available space prior to TMR, resulting in 65\% usage.

Must be greater than or equal to 0. Default: 1.0.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--low}}
Specify the (inclusive) lower bound of the Factor Value for Multiple EDIF
Creation. This value is interpreted according to the \texttt{factorType}
specified, as described above.

Must be used with \texttt{--high}.

Must be greater than or equal to 0.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--high}}
Specify the (inclusive) upper bound of the Factor Value for Multiple EDIF
Creation. This value is interpreted according to the \texttt{factorType}
specified, as described above.

Must be used with \texttt{--low}.

Must be greater than or equal to 0.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--inc}}
Specify the step size of the Factor Value for Multiple EDIF Creation.

For example, if the lower bound is 0.25, the upper bound is 0.75, and the step
size is 0.15, then BLTmr will run, starting with a Factor Value of 0.25, then
0.40, then 0.55, and will end with 0.70.

Must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. Default: 1.0

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Half Latch Removal Options}
The following options determine if and how half-latch removal should be
performed in the resulting EDIF file. Half-latches are constants found
throughout FPGA designs which increase sensitivity but, if upset, \emph{cannot}
be corrected through scrubbing, because they are not determined by the
configuration bits. The BLTmr tool can remove most of the half-latches from the
input EDIF file, prior to performing TMR, significantly increasing reliability.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--removeHL}}
Remove half-latches in the input design before performing TMR.

Note: Not \emph{all} half-latches can be removed at the EDIF 
level for all architectures. Some post-processing may be necessary.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--hlConst} $\{0,1\}$}
Sets the polarity of the half-latch constant to be used, whether an 
internally-generated constant or a top-level port. 

Valid options are \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}. Default: \texttt{0}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--hlUsePort <hlPortName>}}
Specify a top-level port to use in place of half-latches when 
using half-latch removal. The top-level port will have the name specified with 
this option and the polarity (1 or 0) specified with the \texttt{--hlConst} 
option.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--packRegisters} \{i\textbar o\textbar b\textbar n\}}
By default, the BLTmr tool treats all ports on the input EdifCell as top-level
ports (those that will be the inputs and outputs of the FPGA). The half-latch 
tool must therefore treat any FFs that will be packed into the IOBs differently
than other FFs (at least with Virtex devices). This option allows the user to
specify which IOBs the registers should be packed into: inputs (\emph{i}),
outputs (\emph{o}), both (\emph{b}), or none (\emph{n}). The default is to pack
both input and output registers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Target Technology and Part Options}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--technology <techname>}}
Target architecture for the triplicated design. Used to take into account 
various technology-specific properties. This argument is \emph{not} 
case-sensitive.

Valid technologies: \texttt{Virtex} and \texttt{Virtex2}. Default: 
\texttt{Virtex}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--part <partname>}}
Target architecture for the triplicated design. Used to take into account 
part-specific properties, including the number of resources available 
in each part. Valid parts include all parts from the \emph{Virtex} and 
\emph{Virtex2} product lines, represented as a concatenation of the part name 
and package type. For example, the ``Xilinx Virtex 1000 FG680'' is represented 
as \texttt{XCV1000FG680}. This argument is \emph{not} case-sensitive.

Default: \texttt{xcv1000fg680}.
% TODO: Add list of all supported part numbers. All parts listed in
% XilinxVirtexDeviceUtilizationTracker.java and
% XilinxIIVirtexDeviceUtilizationTracker.java

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Log, Report, and Configuration File Options}
The following options determine where the summary, log, and domain report
information are printed.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--summary}}
\textbf{Deprecated} - TMR summary is always displayed

\subsubsection{\texttt{--log <logfile>}}
The name of the BLTmr log file, which records the options used along with
the runtime details and results. 

Default: \texttt{BLTmr.log}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--domainReport <domainReport>}}
The name of the domain report file. The domain report lists the domain (0, 1, 
or 2) of each cell instance in the resulting EDIF file. This report is used as 
input to the LANL RadDRC half-latch removal tool. 

Default: \texttt{BLTmr\_domain\_report.txt}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Configuration File Options}
\label{config options}
The BLTmr tool can use configuration files in place of command-line parameters. 
If a parameter is specified in a configuration file, it will be passed to the 
BLTmr tool, unless it is overridden by the same argument on the command-line. 
The files \texttt{BLTmr.conf}, in the curent working directory, and 
\texttt{/etc/BLTmr/BLTmr.conf}, will be used as source files for default 
parameters. If either or both of these files do not exist, it will not cause a 
problem. (See section \ref{using config}, ``Using Configuration Files'' for
more information.)

\subsubsection{\texttt{--useConfig <config\_file>}}
\label{useConfig}
Specify an additional configuration file from which to read parameters.

The order of precedence for BLTmr options:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Command-line
  \item Configuration file specified by the \texttt{--useConfig} option
  \item Configuration file \texttt{BLTmr.conf} in the current directory
  \item Configuration file \texttt{/etc/BLTmr/BLTmr.conf}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\texttt{--writeConfig[:<config\_file>]}}
Write the current set of command-line parameters to a configuration file and 
exit. The parameters will be parsed to ensure they are valid, but the BLTmr tool
will not run.  Note that only the parameters on the command-line are stored in
the configuration file. When using \texttt{--writeConfig}, any use of
\texttt{--useConfig} is ignored. This is to prevent complicated cascades
of configuration files combined with command-line options.

This option can be called in two ways. First, specifying simply 
\texttt{--writeConfig} will cause the command-line parameters to be written to 
the configuration file \texttt{BLTmr.conf} in the current working directory. 
Second, if followed with a colon and a filename, the command-line parameters 
will be written to the specified file. 

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{--writeConfig} will write the command-line parameters to the
  file \texttt{BLTmr.conf}.
  \item \texttt{--writeConfig:JonSmith.conf} will write the command-line 
  parameters to the file \texttt{JonSmith.conf}.
  \item \texttt{--writeConfig:/usr/lib/BLTmr/common.conf} will write the
  command-line pa\-ram\-e\-ters to the file \texttt{/usr/share/BLTmr/common.conf}. 
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Help and Version Information}
If either of the following options are used, the appropriate information will be
printed and the program will exit.

\subsubsection{\texttt{-h|--help}}
Print (to \texttt{stdout}) usage and detailed help information (similar to the 
contents of this document) and exit.

\subsubsection{\texttt{-v|--version}}
Print (to \texttt{stdout}) version and copyright information and exit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Common Usage}
This section describes a few sample scenarios and explains which combination of
command line options should be used for each.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Full TMR}
\label{subsec:fulltmr}
This example shows how to perform ``full'' TMR (triplication of all components) 
on a design. For larger designs, this may result in a TMR'd version of the 
design that does not fit in the desired chip. If this is the case, some form of 
``partial'' TMR should be used.

In this example, the design to be triplicated is specified in the file 
\texttt{myDesign.edf} and the triplicated design will be written to 
\texttt{myDesign\_tmr.edf}. Both input ports and output ports are triplicated. 
The part used in this case is the Virtex II XC2V1000-FG456.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myDesign.edf -o myDesign_tmr.edf \
  --tmr_inports --tmr_outports --full_tmr --technology Virtex2 --part xc2v1000fg456
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Full TMR---Clock not triplicated}
Some systems do not support triplicated clock lines. This example shows how to 
triplicate everything but the clock line.

This example is almost identical to the example in section 
\ref{subsec:fulltmr}. The \texttt{--no\_tmr\_p} option specifies that the 
top-level port named \texttt{Clk} (case-sensitive) should not be triplicated. 
The \texttt{--no\_tmr\_c} option indicates that all cells of the global clock 
buffer type \texttt{BUFG} should also not be triplicated. This prevents the 
clock line after the buffer from being triplicated and the entire circuit will 
use the same single clock.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myDesign.edf -o myDesign_tmr_singleClock.edf \
 --tmr_inports --tmr_outports --full_tmr --no_tmr_p Clk --no_tmr_c BUFG --technology \
 Virtex2 --part xc2v1000fg456
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Full TMR---No I/O triplication}
Many FPGA applications are port-limited. This example shows how to prevent all 
inputs and outputs from being triplicated. In this example, the user must leave 
out the \texttt{--tmr\_inports} and \texttt{--tmr\_outports} parameters so that 
top level ports are not included in triplication. This example also leaves out 
the \texttt{--technology} and \texttt{--part} options, using the default values 
for each (Virtex XCV1000-FG680).

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myDesign.edf -o myDesign_tmr_singleIO.edf \
 --full_tmr
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR---No I/O triplication, External EDIF files}
This example shows a standard usage of the BLTmr tool for partial TMR\@. In this 
case, the design is too large to fit in the targeted device when fully 
triplicated. The BLTmr tool will triplicate as much logic as possible and 
estimate when the target chip will be fully utilized.

This design also requires some external EDIF files that are referenced in 
\texttt{myLargeDesign.edf} as ``black boxes.'' These external files, which are 
located in the \texttt{externalSrcDir} directory, will be incorporated into the 
triplicated design. Thus, the external files will not be needed with the 
\texttt{myLargeDesign\_BLTmr.edf} output file.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myLargeDesign.edf -o myLargeDesign_BLTmr.edf \
  -d ./externalSrcDir
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR---SCC Decomposition, custom estimation factors}
In this case, the user wishes to include parts of strongly-connected components 
(SCCs) for triplication. This example also shows how to override the default
merge and optimization factors.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myLargeDesign.edf -o myLargeDesign_BLTmr.edf \
  -d ./externalSrcDir --doSCCDecomposition --mergeFactor 0.4 --optimizationFactor 0.85
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR---Fill 50\% of target device}
In some cases, the user may wish to use the triplicated design on the same chip 
as another design. In this example the user knows that a separate design will 
require half of the target chip. To fill as much of the left-over 50\% as 
possible, the user specifies a \texttt{--factor\_type} of \texttt{DUF} and a 
\texttt{factor\_value} of \texttt{0.5}. This will stop triplication of the 
input design when half of the target chip is utilized, according to the 
estimate made with the merge optimization factors.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myLargeDesign.edf -o myLargeDesign_ptmr_50pc.edf \
  -d ./externalSrcDir --factor_type DUF --factor_value 0.5
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR---Push utilization past 100\%}
Due to the way mapping tools are implemented, the user may be able to fit more 
logic onto the target chip than estimated by the utilization tracker. The 
Xilinx \texttt{map} program, for example, does not map unrelated logic into the 
same slice until slice utilization reaches 99\%. This means that much more 
logic can be added after this point, though the place and route step will 
become increasingly more difficult for the tools to perform.

With this in mind, to achieve the maximum capacity on the target chip, it may 
be necessary to specify a desired utilization factor greater than 1.0 (more 
than 100\% estimated utilization). The following example uses a device 
utilization factor of 1.5, which will stop triplication when an estimated 150\% 
of the target part is utilized.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myLargeDesign.edf -o \
 myLargeDesign_ptmr_150pc.edf -d ./externalSrcDir --factor_type DUF --factor_value 1.5
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Partial TMR---Use 75\% of available space on target device}
The available space utilization factor can be used to specify the amount of
space on the target device left after the unmitigated circuit is mapped. To
fill the chip up to 75\% of the left-over space, the user specifies a 
\texttt{--factor\_type} of \texttt{ASUF} and a \texttt{factor\_value} of 
\texttt{0.75}. If the original design size is estimated at using 40\% of the
target chip, this will stop triplication when 70\% ($40 + (100-40)*0.75$) of
the target chip is utilized.

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myLargeDesign.edf -o myLargeDesign_ptmr_50pc.edf \
  -d ./externalSrcDir --factor_type DUF --factor_value 0.5
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Using Configuration Files}
\label{using config}
Configuration files can greatly simplify the use of the BLTmr tool. The following 
examples show how to create and use configuration files. (See section
\ref{config options}, ``Configuration File Options'' for more information.)

\subsubsection{Create a Configuration File}
The following will write the current command-line arguments to the file
\texttt{myConfig.conf}:

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myDesign.edf -o myDesign_BLTmr.edf -f \ 
subcell.edf,/usr/share/edifFiles/subcell2.edf, -d /usr/share/edif/common/ \ 
--tmr_inports --tmr_outports --tmr_c DLL,fdc,clk_buf --tmr_i clk,fifo_output \ 
--no_tmr_p clk_port,data_in --no_tmr_c bufg --no_tmr_i mux2,and24 \ 
--notmrFeedForward --inputAdditionType 1 --outputAdditionType 2 --mergeFactor \ 
0.85 --optimizationFactor 0.90 --availableSpaceUtilizationFactor 0.85 \
--removeHL --hlConst 0 --hlUsePort hl_port --technology Virtex2 --part \
XCV1000FG680 --summary --log myLogFile.log --domainReport myDomainReport.txt \
--writeConfig:myConfig.conf
\end{verbatim}

The previous command creates the following output, stored in 
\texttt{myConfig.conf}:

\begin{verbatim}
#myConfig.conf, created by byucc.edif.tools.jsap.NMRCommandParser
#Sat Jul 22 19:51:14 MDT 2006
hlUsePort=hl_port
availableSpaceUtilizationFactor=0.85
tmr_c=DLL,fdc,clk_buf
summary=true
optimizationFactor=0.9
log=myLogFile.log
notmrFeedForward=true
output=myDesign_BLTmr.edf
hlConst=0
input=myDesign.edf
outputAdditionType=2
mergeFactor=0.85
removeHL=true
dir=/usr/share/edif/common/
writeConfig=myConfig.conf
part=XCV1000FG680
no_tmr_p=clk_port,data_in
technology=Virtex2
domainReport=myDomainReport.txt
inputAdditionType=1
no_tmr_i=mux2,and24
file=subcell.edf,/usr/share/edifFiles/subcell2.edf
no_tmr_c=bufg
tmr_i=clk,fifo_output
tmr_outports=true
tmr_inports=true
\end{verbatim}

Configuration files are defined by the \texttt{java.util.Properties} class. 
However, the format is simple enough that configuration files can easily be 
created by hand or by other programs. As seen above, the format is simply 
\texttt{key=value}. A hash mark (pound sign) (\texttt{\#}) at the beginning of 
a line marks that line as a comment. BLTmr options are given just as they would 
be on the command-line, with the exception that command-line options with no 
arguments (e.g. \texttt{--tmr\_inports}, \texttt{--summary}, 
\texttt{--doSCCDecomposition}, etc.) are specified as either \texttt{true} or 
\texttt{false}, as seen above.

\subsubsection{Use a Configuration File}

The following example shows how to load \texttt{myConfig.conf} as a configuration
file:

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR --useConfig myConfig.conf
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Combining Configuration Files and Command-line Arguments}
Configuration files provide default values of BLTmr options. Any options 
specified on the command-line will take precedence. (See section 
\ref{useConfig}, ``\texttt{--useConfig}'' for detailed precedence information.)
The following example uses the same options specified by myConfig.conf, but
changes the input and output files:

\begin{verbatim}
> java byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR myOtherDesign.edf -o myOtherDesign_BLTmr.edf \
 --useConfig myConfig.conf
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Special Notes}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Naming Conventions}
\label{naming conventions}
The BLTmr tool alters the names of triplicated signals, cell instances, and 
ports. Be aware of this when using placement (or other) constraints. An output 
port named \texttt{myOutport} in the original EDIF file will, when triplicated, 
become \texttt{myOutport\_TMR\_0, myOutport\_TMR\_1, and myOutport\_TMR\_2}. 
Similarly, a flip-flop whose instance name is \texttt{myFF} in the original file
will become \texttt{myFF\_TMR\_0}, \texttt{myFF\_TMR\_1}, 
\texttt{and myFF\_TMR\_2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Allocating More Memory for the JVM}
Larger designs may require more heap memory than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
is allocated by default. Use the \texttt{-Xmx}\footnote{See
\url{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/java.html\#Xms} for
more information about this and other command-line options to the JVM.} option 
with the Java executable to change the maximum amount of memory for the virtual
machine. The following example allocates up to 256 MB of heap space for the JVM:

\begin{verbatim}
> java -Xmx256M byucc.edif.tools.tmr.FlattenTMR ...
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{RLOC Constraints}
The BLTmr tool does not support RLOC constraints at this time. RLOC constraints 
must therefore be removed before processing the resulting EDIF file. RLOCs may 
be removed from the either the source EDIF files (including any external EDIF 
files) or from the triplicated output file. Automated RLOC removal may be added 
to the tool in a later release.

To remove RLOC constraints from an EDIF file, you can use the UNIX 
\texttt{grep} tool. The following example uses \texttt{grep} to find all lines 
in the source EDIF file \texttt{myDesign\_BLTmr.edf} that do \emph{not} contain 
the string \texttt{RLOC} and copy them to the destination EDIF file 
\texttt{myDesign\_tmr\_noRLOCs.edf.} Note that you may \emph{not} use the same 
file for the source and destination.

\begin{verbatim}
> grep -v RLOC myDesign_BLTmr.edf > myDesign_BLTmr_noRLOCs.edf
\end{verbatim}

This trick is guaranteed to work for EDIF files created by the BLTmr tool as 
well as all Xilinx CoreGen EDIF files. It is \emph{not} guaranteed to work for 
all EDIF files in general since it relies on the fact that each RLOC constraint 
with its associated parentheses do not spread across multiple lines (which is 
not required by the EDIF file format). For example, it does not work for EDIF 
files created with the JHDL netlister.
