<!-- One sentance summary -->
Provides tools to perform Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), Duplication With Comparison (DWC), and other mitigation techniques.

<!-- Put more details on the package here -->
TMR and DWC belong to the more general class of mitigation techniques involving replication of circuit elements. This class of techniques is collectively referred to as "NMR," implying that a variable scale of replication is available.  For example, Duplication With Detection (DWC) is NMR with an N of 2; Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is NMR with an N of 3.
