Goals for TMR:
--------------

Higher priorities:

- Add different types of Input/Output searching logic (depth first,
breadth first, etc) and compare results from each
- Investigate different methods of selecting partial feedback and
compare results
- Run 100 levels of TMR for a certain design and create several
interesting plots from the results (James' project)
- Create and test duplication with correction


Lower priorities:

- Add support for DLL stuff (don't vote on DLL feedback...) and
asynchronous loops
- Choose which end of an edge to cut more intelligently
- Add support for script/build files rather than command-line options only
- VHDL/Verilog template generation
