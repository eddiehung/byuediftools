\section{JEdifVoterSelection}
JEdifVoterSelection determines the locations where voters will be
inserted into a triplicated design (or triplicated portions of a
design). Voter locations are determined using a feedback cutset
algorithm and rules for voting where downscaling is necessary. The
results are added into the replication description file (.rdesc).

At times, the user may wish to force voter insertion on certain nets and
disable voter insertion on others. This can be accomplished by inserting
\texttt{`force\_restore'} and \texttt{`do\_not\_restore'} properties on
selected nets in the .edf file as follows:\\
\texttt{(property force\_restore (boolean (true)))}\\
\texttt{(property do\_not\_restore (boolean (true)))}\\

\subsection{Cutset Algorithms}
This tool can use several different algorithms to determine where to place
voters so that the voters cut all the feedback in the design. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{--highest\_ff\_fanout\_cutset}}
This algorighm finds the flip-flop with the highest fanout in each SCC and 
places a voter on the output. This algorithm has proven very good at reducing 
the number of paths that have more than one voter between flip-flops and gives
good timing and area results. This is the default algorithm.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--highest\_fanout\_cutset}}
This algorithm finds the instance with the highest fanout in each SCC.
It then places a voter on this output. This algorithm has proven worse 
at reducing the number of voters between flip-flops.

\subsubsection{\texttt{--connectivity\_cutset}}
This is the original algorithm that removes arbitray feedback edges until all
feedback is cut. This option has been shown to produce inferior results in
general to the other two but in some few cases it \emph{may} give better timing
results (not likely in real-world designs).
