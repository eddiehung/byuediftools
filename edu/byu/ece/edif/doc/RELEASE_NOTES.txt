 Release Notes for BYU EDIF Tools

Electron Release (16 April 2008)

To whom it may concern:

The BYU Configurable Computing Lab is please to announce the public
release of the BYU EDIF Tools open source project!  This project
provides an API for manipulating EDIF netlists in Java. We use this
API to analyze netlists as a part of our FPGA reliability project. We
intend to keep the API as general as possible to support other netlist
analysis and manipulation activities.

This release is named "electron" and is our first public offering of
the source code.  For a brief orientation on BYU EDIF Tools, please

Feel free to submit modifications to our group.  We will happily
integrate any improvements to the code.  We welcome developers to
contribute to the project.
