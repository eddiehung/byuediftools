<!-- One sentance summary -->
A repository for EDIF-specific tools which are generally end-user tools.

<!-- Put more details on the package here -->
Major tools using this EDIF framework are located here. These tools are 
generally not small utilities, but end-user tools. These include tools
to flatten the hierarchy of a circuit, tools to replicate a circuit (triple 
modular redundancy, duplication with compare), tools to "sterilize" a
circuit (removing/replacing problematic elements), etc.
